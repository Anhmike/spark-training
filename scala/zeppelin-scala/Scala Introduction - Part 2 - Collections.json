But at the same time, Scala also offers the concept of so called <em>partial functions</em>, which are Scala functions which are not defined for every possible value for their parameters. From this point of view, an incomplete <code>match</code> is just such a partial function.</p>\n<p>Collections provide a method <code>collect</code> in addition to <code>map</code>, which works seamlessly with partial functions. <code>collect</code> will transform all values where the partial function is defined at and it will filter out all other values. This is very handy for complex <code>match</code> operations where a preceding <code>filter</code> opreation would duplicate logic and therefore violate the DRY approach (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself).</p>\n</div>"}},{"text":"(1 to 10) map { case i:Int if i%2==0 => i/2 }","dateUpdated":"2018-11-10T17:29:03+0000","config":{"editorMode":"ace/mode/text","colWidth":12,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"editorSetting":{"language":"scala","editOnDblClick":false},"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1541870852312_-233747475","id":"20160619-075222_1256662395","dateCreated":"2018-11-10T17:27:32+0000","status":"ERROR","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:16110","user":"anonymous","dateFinished":"2018-11-10T17:29:03+0000","dateStarted":"2018-11-10T17:29:03+0000","result":{"code":"ERROR","type":"TEXT","msg":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscala.MatchError: 1 (of class java.lang.Integer)\n  at $anonfun$1.apply$mcII$sp(<console>:34)\n  at $anonfun$1.apply(<console>:34)\n  at $anonfun$1.apply(<console>:34)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.immutable.Range.foreach(Range.scala:160)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$class.map(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.AbstractTraversable.map(Traversable.scala:104)\n  ... 48 elided\n"}},{"text":"(1 to 10) collect { case i:Int if i%2==0 => i/2 }","dateUpdated":"2018-11-10T17:29:03+0000","config":{"editorMode":"ace/mode/text","colWidth":12,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"editorSetting":{"language":"scala","editOnDblClick":false},"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1541870852312_-233747475","id":"20160619-074637_1204436823","dateCreated":"2018-11-10T17:27:32+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:16111","user":"anonymous","dateFinished":"2018-11-10T17:29:03+0000","dateStarted":"2018-11-10T17:29:03+0000","result":{"code":"SUCCESS","type":"TEXT","msg":"\nres136: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n"}},{"text":"%md\nExplicitly defining a partial function cannot be done via the `def` keyword - this will always create a normal function.
