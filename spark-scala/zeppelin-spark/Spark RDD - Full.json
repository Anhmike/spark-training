For example iterative algorithms may benefit from <em>caching</em> intermediate results, if the same RDD is transformed again and again. Spark provides some capabilities to persist intermediate results using the methods <code>cache()</code> or <code>persist(storageLevel)</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that also caching is lazy, which means that records will not be created at the time when you call <code>cache()</code> or <code>persist()</code> but at the first time when the RDD is evaluated. This could be even a simple <code>count()</code> action.</p>\n</div>"},"dateCreated":"2018-11-10T11:53:08+0000","dateStarted":"2018-11-10T17:04:08+0000","dateFinished":"2018-11-10T17:04:08+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:192"},{"text":"val rdd = sc.parallelize(0 to 1000)\nrdd.setName(\"Numbers 0 to 1000\").cache()\nprintln(rdd.count())","dateUpdated":"2018-11-10T17:04:31+0000","config":{"editorMode":"ace/mode/scala","colWidth":12,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"editorSetting":{"language":"scala","editOnDblClick":false},"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1541850788712_1635660934","id":"20160617-161253_1903777045","dateCreated":"2018-11-10T11:53:08+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:193","user":"anonymous","dateFinished":"2018-11-10T17:04:32+0000","dateStarted":"2018-11-10T17:04:31+0000","result":{"code":"SUCCESS","type":"TEXT","msg":"\nrdd: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Int] = ParallelCollectionRDD[128] at parallelize at <console>:31\n\nres57: rdd.type = Numbers 0 to 1000 ParallelCollectionRDD[128] at parallelize at <console>:31\n1001\n"}},{"config":{"colWidth":12,"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}},"enabled":true,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1541869572064_-830119185","id":"20181110-170612_982341174","dateCreated":"2018-11-10T17:06:12+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"focus":true,"$$hashKey":"object:7775","text":"%md\nIn order to free up some memory again, the DataFrame can also be uncached.
