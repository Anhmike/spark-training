The simplest thing is *selecting columns* (i.e. projections). Here we'll immediately see an important difference to RDDs: DataFrames are completely dynamically typed objects. The schema of a DataFrame is not known at compile time (even if it was manually created in code, it is still represented dynamically). This allows a more generic approach and does not requiore to write custom classes for different objects. Everything is a data frame with a dynamically injected schema. Columns are addressed via their names in strings - not as members of some Scala classes.\n\nNevertheless this is already a topic with multiple solutions.

The schema of a DataFrame is not known at compile time (even if it was manually created in code, it is still represented dynamically).
