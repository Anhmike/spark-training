It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!","1.0","1.0"],["Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book","The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.

I am pleased with product. I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn't have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand.
