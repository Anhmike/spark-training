I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.\t5\t1.0\nBaby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink\tThis is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.\t5\t1.0\nOur Baby Girl Memory Book\t\t5\t1.0\nOur Baby Girl Memory Book\tAbsolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.

Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!\t5\t1.0\nMy Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book\tI'm so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.\t5\t1.0\nJellycat Elephant and Mouse Book\tThe book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.

The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.\t2\t0.0\nModern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal\tI could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don't &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.\t5\t1.0\nBlessed By Pope Benedict XVI Divine Mercy Full Color Medal\tvery nice Divine Mercy Pendant of Jesus now on chain around my neck.

They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I'll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I'm ordering more of them right now!\t5\t1.0\nCloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)\tWe bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...\t4\t1.0\nCloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)\tThese were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others\t2\t0.0\nCloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)\tA great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.\t5\t1.0\nCloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black)\tI really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.\t2\t0.0\n","comment":"","msgTable":[[{"key":"review","value":"Planetwise Wipe Pouch"},{"key":"review","value":"it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it."},{"key":"review","value":"5"},{"key":"review","value":"1.0"}],[{"key":"rating","value":"Annas Dream Full Quilt with 2 Shams"},{"key":"rating","value":"Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looks...fit the full size bed perfectly...would recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt"},{"key":"rating","value":"5"},{"key":"rating","value":"1.0"}],[{"key":"sentiment","value":"Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar"},{"key":"sentiment","value":"This was the only calender I could find for the second year.

Champ\tWe had 2 diaper Genie s both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand  required if you are holding your baby    Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing   On top of that the refills are very expensive   So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it   It is very easy to use with one hand   I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy   Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time  the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating  but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone   It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use
