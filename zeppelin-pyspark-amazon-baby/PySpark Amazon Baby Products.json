you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing   On top of that the refills are very expensive   So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it   It is very easy to use with one hand   I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy   Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time  the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating  but I can handle it and I love this product
