    "Sometimes execution plans can get pretty long and Spark might run into trouble. Common scenarios are iterative algorithms like ML or graph algorithms, which contain a big outer loop and iteratively transform a DataFrame over and over again. This would result in a really huge execution plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases you could use `cache()` or `persist()` in order to improve performance (otherwise all steps of the loop would be executed again from the very beginning leading to a runtime of O(n^2)). But this will not cut off the lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointing is the right solution for these cases. It will persist the data of a DataFrame in a reliable distributed storage (most commonly HDFS) and cut off the lineage."
