The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes.

option is a pack that contains 1 key and 2 locks for people who want to try it out and the second option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product  So make sure you really read the description of what you re getting if you re buying online   This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first   I actually rec  it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn t work with all situations because of draw designs  Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product  love it  and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key  I will admit that I think it s pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you re dealing with child safety products  As far as how well the product works   I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations  It s especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don t have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side  I didn t have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn t flush with where you put the catch  I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it s actually a great product  I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there  I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets   I mean give me a break   the holes are so small anyway and it s totally concealed  only you will know it s there  ALSO  this locks so tight that little fingers hands can t reach inside small openings  which usually occures with the other types of locks  and pull stuff out  And also there s an option to turn the lock off for in between kids  DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT     \t1.0\tWrappedArray(what, previous, reviewer, didn,

Freestyle Breast Pump\tI owned a PIS when I was expressing for my daughter 8 years ago and I never had any problems with it  I was an exclusive pumper and maintained a very good milk supply with my PIS for over 6 months until my daughter was eating baby food and I stopped pumping  I made enough milk I could have fed a small village  We weren t planning on having any more children so I gave the pump away after a few years  I know you aren t supposed to do that but I gave it to a family member   It still worked  I hated that you couldn t take the pump out of the bag  though  Dragging that bag everywhere was a pain and was not discrete but it was the best pump on the market at the time When I became pregnant with my son in 2010  surprise   I knew I needed a pump  I was attracted to the Freestyle because it was so small  portable and wasn t attached to a bag  When you pump exclusively  you have to be able to pump whenever and wherever you need to so I chose it over the PIS even though I knew that the PIS could stand up to pumping 8 times per day  I just assumed that because the Medela brand is so respected that their top of the line pump would be able to meet my needs  I also stuck it in a Petunia Pickle Bottom bag which is much cuter than the tote bags that come with these pumps My son was born premature in April and ended up in the NICU  I was given a Medela Symphony with the kit to use while hospitalized to build up my milk supply  I used that for one week and then started using my Freestyle and taking the expressed milk into the unit for my son  The Freestyle worked as well as the Symphony in building my milk supply and I was able to express all my milk in 15 minutes and get large volumes  I used the pump everywhere with a breastfeeding cover  I pumped in the car  in the ladies lounge  in lactation rooms at Babies R Us  in the NICU  at my daughter s school  etc  It is so convenient   I could not have been happier and didn t mind the  370  I spent on the pump About three weeks ago I started to have issues with low volume when I pumped  I have an overabundant milk supply so I thought it was strange that I was having problems  I replaced the valves  I had only been using the pump for 7 weeks so I was annoyed that the valve already needed to be replaced  and I still got varying degrees of milk  I started Fenugreek and included more water in my diet  The problems persisted until I ended up with a clogged milk duct three days ago with no volume at all out of one breast  I had to pump for 45 minutes to get any milk at all out of the non clogged breast  BTW  the pump cuts itself off at 32 minutes so I had to restart it each time   I didn t think it was my pump since I never had any problems with the PIS and the pump was still making its WAH WAH noise so out of desperation  I paid a private lactation consultant  100 to meet with her  The first thing she did was test the suction on my Freestyle  It was HALF what it should have been even jacked all the way up to L8  I have only been using the pump for 11 weeks and the motor burned out  There is no way I could continue to use it unless I wanted to lose my milk supply  My son has terrible reflux and can t tolerate formula so the faulty pump was a crisis at my house  So  I rented a Medela Lactina hospital grade pump for  50 bucks and I was able to recover  I am using it as I write this but I am going back to work in two weeks and I can t possibly tote the Lactina to work  Plus  I already spent  400 on the Freestyle and don t want to keep paying the rental fees on the Lactina I called Medela this morning and they are replacing the pump  no questions asked  I don t even have the receipt anymore and they were fine with that  They are even overnighting it to me  The ease with which they agreed to replace my pump makes me wonder if they know there is an issue with this pump  The customer service was wonderful which is such a relief since you can t always count on that  The rep let me know that the pump motor had been redesigned and I shouldn t have any more problems with it  including the black dust problem which I also had  Who knows if that is true  I am certainly going to be more on top of any volume issues this time So   PROS  Convenience  convenience  convenience   you can take this pump anywhere   Works as well as a hospital grade pump  assuming the motor keeps going  and you can establish a milk supply with it  If you only plan to pump two or three times a day while away from your baby  it is probably a great pumpCONS It does not seem to be durable enough for exclusive pumping  The PIS worked like a charm for exclusive pumping   Expense   it is the most expensive personal pump on the market so it is very annoying that quality didn t match price The Softshields that come with the pump turn yellow and warp  meaning they will need to be replaced frequently  I replaced the first set within days of first using them because I put them in the steam sterilizer and they warped   would have been nice if Medela had let me know not to do this   cost  14   Once my milk supply was established  the Softshields were too small for my breasts and I had to purchase the larger size hard plastic shields  costing me another  14  They also are not as comfortable as the Softshields   The valve has to be replaced frequently and you have to buy the entire portion that attaches to the shields  You can t just replace the rubber valve  cost  19    Taking all the parts apart and cleaning them after every pump is annoying and time consuming  Much more complicated than the PIS parts   It is finicky   if you don t have the parts snapped on just right  there is no suction  I have to adjust multiple times while pumping   It leaks milk on you if you bend over because of a giant gap in the part that holds the valve  I ve lost ounces   The Freestyle cost me  370 for the pump   14 to replace the less then durable Softshields   14 to purchase larger breast shields since the pump only comes with one size   19 to replace the valves   100 to meet with the LC and  50 to rent the Lactina   Not to mention the stress it caused me by losing suction and messing up my milk supply and the pain of the clogged duct  Thanks to the Lactina  my supply has been saved and I am back to only having to pump for 15 minutes  I certainly hope the new Freestyle doesn t die on me My advice  if you plan on doing a lot of pumping  or find yourself needing to even though it wasn t your plan   get the PIS Metro bag  It seems to combine the best of both worlds   a reliable  strong pump that is more portable than the regular PIS because you can remove the pump from the bag  It is also cheaper I hope this helps someone make a better choice than I did  I really wish I had the PIS Metro bag but can t justify spending anymore money on breast pumps \t0.0\t[-405.7956916274106,405.7956916274106]\t1.0\nRoan Rocco Classic Pram Stroller 2-in-1 with Bassinet and Seat Unit - Coffee\tGreat Pram Rocco      I bought this pram from Europe  unfortunately it was not available on Amazon back then and cost me tons of money  This pram is so great I ve decided to give my opinion on it First of all let me notice that I can t imagine how to raise kids without pram  I have three kids and it was the most useful and practical purchase for baby I made  even I paid a fortune for it back then   I used it everyday all year around  When you have kids specially newborns and toddlers  you don t get much excise plus I was getting really tired staying at home  So  I compensated it by long walks around neighborhood with our first baby and then taking toddlers to playground or for a walk while baby was sleeping in pram or I would just sent helper out with kids and enjoy some quite time at home Let me tell you one thing that out weights everything else  babies sleep much better outside then inside  at home  I guess the fresh air and a lot of oxygen make the trick   so  whenever it was possible I took them outside  I was not happy using a car seat or other strollers for that as I worried about their back and spine  The pram from other side keeps their back in correct position as it has flat and firm bottom  I think none of the strollers that you convert from one position to another provides such a nice flat surface for baby  specially for newborns  to sleep soundly for few hours   When our first daughter got bigger we used this pram with seat unit and visited a lot of places like zoo  botanic garden and parks  The amortization is great and it gives very smooth ride  while kids in other strollers were trembling all the way Here are few things I really love about this pram   Smart  It has the smoothest ride on bouncy sidewalks and park trails  I guess it is because of pram s suspension and large air pumped wheels  Bassinet is large enough that I use it for quite long time  It even fits now my 5 months old in snowsuit bundled in wool sleeping bag and there is some space left   Folded chassis  You can detach bassinet seat unit and fold the chassis just in few minutes  Cargo of our sedan provides enough space to put chassis and seat there  the bassinet is too high to put into the cargo with chassis   We also used to detach the bassinet with baby sleeping in it and bring it inside  it has handles to carry  when the weather gets really rough or when we have to go home and I don t want to wake her up   The seat bassinet can face both ways  It s not so important for bassinet  but very nice for seat unit as babies grow they want to see more and enjoy the ride observing  The back of the seat and the footrest can be adjusted up and down and they can make quite a long flat surface for toddler to sleep   Rain cover  I paid extra  but looks like its included here  allows you to be safe in any weather condition  I used it during snow and windy time also    You can easily adjust height of the handle  it was great for us because we  my husband and I  are really different sizes   The metal basket provides enough space to put some things when you out and it s very convenient  I actually used it to take some toys on playground with us Bottom line I think Rocco is an excellent pram stroller and I use this pram all the time and I don t know what I would do without it  The only thing I regret they didn t sell it here before

my baby is fearful in public of strangers etc I am very much into babywearing and am a huge fan of Boba and tout the Boba 3G all the time to my friends   I use the 3G multiple times a week   It s very comfortable and my 1 year old  25 pound  baby loves it   We have used it since birth and it has grown with us I thought the Boba Air  BA  would be great for the summer since it s more lightweight and we do get pretty hot in the 3G   I was so excited to get it in the mail   I also have a Bitybean  BB  and so I was excited to compare them   I was sure the BA would blow BB out of the water NOT SO The big thing to me was the straps  The BA has wider straps than the BB   This is the only improvement I see in it over the BB   FYI  The BA does not have padding in the straps and there is a thick wire in the seam closest to your neck   It s horrible and I hate the wire   The straps pull down at the shoulders and don t distribute the weight to the waist like the 3G   It could be that I have a chunky baby  but he is well within the weight limits for the carrier My comparison of the Bitybean and the Boba AirStraps  BB has narrow and they are not super comfortable  BA has wide and they are not comfortable eitherFabric   BB is very thin and stretchy  almost like a wetsuit combined with a raincoat    It has breathable mesh  BA doesn t have any mesh  but is a thin fabric Comfort  BB pulls at the shoulders  BA pulls at the shouldersCompactness  BB wins by a mile  It folds up into a bag about the size of a waterbottle and can be stowed in the side pocket of a diaper bag   BA folds up into it s own pocket and is about the size of a clutch purse or a 4 diapers stacked together Design   BB comes in 4 colors and the design is more sleek   BA comes in black and blue on Amazon  I have seen white    I find black to be hotter in the sun Getting Wet   BB can be used in the pool  needs to be rinsed after   BA can get sprinkled on but not submersed Accessories   BB has a hood sold separately   15  and a fleece insert   19    I consider the hood to be a necessity   BA comes with the hood  no extra cost   Bonus for BA Cost   BB is  60    15 for the hood  BA is  65   hood is included Overall  I feel like lots of thought has gone into the BB to make it wonderful and the BA was an afterthought of the 3G   The BA is getting returned to Amazon and the BB is the winner in our house   I hope in a later edition they will make the waist and shoulder straps wider  that would make a huge difference \t0.0\t[-360.8806663463295,360.8806663463295]\t1.0\nImse Vimse Organic Cotton Terry Dribble Bibs - Shades of Pink\tWhen baby hit 3 months she turned into a drool machine  Most of the bibs I had were those little cheapos that are made of some thin synthetic fabric that soaks through right away  I searched amazon for the best bibs for droolers and picked a few with decent reviews to try aden   anais 3 Pack Nibble Snap BibsImse Vimse Organic Cotton Terry Dribble BibsTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding BibBaby is now 7 months and the drooling is gone  so we re not using bibs much at the moment  When I was using them  I liked the aden and anais best The Imse Vimse are very small which would have been fine for my purpose and they had the nicest colors to me  fairly nuetral so they went with most outfits  They also fit nice and snug around the neck due to the tie  The bib cotton was thick and absorbent  but I rarely used them because the edging is made with some terrible rough fabric  If it s cotton  they must be breeding a new special type with the texture of    gosh  I m trying to think of a fabric with such a terrible texture  but I don t know what it would be  Suffice it to say that it doesn t belong in the sensitive neck rolls of a little baby  So  these got very little use The Tommy Tippy are nice and probably well suited to keeping milk out of the neck rolls  but the bib itself is a thin synthetic material and not all that absorbant  So  they soak through too quickly to be of much use for a serious drooling problem  The bib size is perfect  not tiny like the Imse Vimse and not huge like Aden and Anais  I don t love the velcro  you have to be careful that it doesn t snag other things in the wash and if you don t line it up perfectly it can irritate baby s skin  The snaps on Aden and Anais are better Finally  my favorite ended up being the Aden and Anais which are designed for eating  not drooling  They are huge  more of a smock on a 3 month old  but this is perfect for an eating bib  At three months baby wasn t mobile yet  so being too large was no biggie  if I need to resume use  it may interfere with her crawling as they hang past the waist  They were also a big big around the neck for little one but we didn t seem to have a big probelm with the drool running into her neck so this worked out ok  The reason I loved them is that they are so soft and so absorbant  they never soaked through with the drool and I could take the long bib and wipe her face with it  The Imse Vimse were too small for this and the Tommy Tippy not absorbant enough  Another possible advantage is the rather loud pattern does not show stains as much as the plainer bibs  I do wish they came in more color options  I don t love either choice  but on the whole I am happy and I know these will last forever  like the Aden and Anais blankets  they just get better with washing \t0.0\t[-333.60166337282146,333.60166337282146]\t1.0\nRoan Rocco Classic Pram Stroller 2-in-1 with Bassinet and Seat Unit - Coffee\t  1045   1089   1083   1080    1074   1099

smashing value  to boot   This  along with the 8 oz version that we also used  is one of those products When I told my wife how much I loved these bottles  she just shook her head as if to say  The poor man has gone mental    Sure  I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles  but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value   Also  I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial  terrifying  experience to shopping for feeding supplies   It was my mission  you see  to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work    baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk      No problem  I thought   Go to the store  grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes  I thought   Whoa   First time parents  you know what I am talking about   go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled  feeding  and there it is   a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long    seemed like 100 feet long at the time   Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles  and we re not even talking about nipples   My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later  exhausted and overwhelmed   With no bottles   OK  so the review   We wanted bottles with no BPA  which was beginning to make big news a few years ago  so we explored non BPA options   There were plastic ones  but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were    you know  PETE  HDPE  LDPE  etc  with those little triangles on the bottom   That made me unsure of plastic   Then we considered glass   Would they break   Sure  if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface  but we decided we d be careful   So  these glass bottles have no BPA   Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing  so we don t have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing   And  another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesn t wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings   These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass  so they ll wear out when the bottle wears out   Which is never They are colorless   We like that also   You can see what s in the bottle  and you can also tell when they are clean   I mean  there s nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots  right   We ve seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time  and I don t like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinking They are durable   Unless you clean them with steel wool  these bottles won t scratch   Can t say that about plastic   They also won t melt  either  when you boil them to sterilize   BPA free plastic may be great when it is cold  but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees   Any glass is breakable  but our daughter didn t break a single one in almost two years   And she tried   I found them to be as sturdy  when using and cleaning them  as our drinking glasses   No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass  but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with baby s bottles than with any other glass she is around   car windows  house windows  drinking glasses  dishes  etc    When baby turned to toddler  however  the deal s off  as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold   Nowadays it s nothing but titanium plates and bowls for her   Value   This one s a biggie   Nothing s too good for my daughter  a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth  I reckon   But these are reasonable   You ve seen other glass bottles  the ones that ape the  no BPA  angle  the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles   Yikes   I looked at them  and they re fine bottles  but we re talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument  for me   Besides  I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple  but also a top cap  and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple    ask me how I know Other nice things   These come in common sense sizes  4 and 8 ounces   Also  they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves   for those of you so inclined   so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge   Cool    yeah  my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this   Most importantly of all  they worked great for our daughter   No gas  no fussiness  no issues at all with the nipples  which do vent    there s a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you don t over tighten the ring Are these bottles perfect   Not universally  I m sure  but they were perfect for us and we ll be using them for our next little one   One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary    they come with different flow rates    Who knew

my daughter 8 years ago and I never had any problems with it  I was an exclusive pumper and maintained a very good milk supply with my PIS for over 6 months until my daughter was eating baby food and I stopped pumping  I made enough milk I could have fed a small village  We weren t planning on having any more children so I gave the pump away after a few years  I know you aren t supposed to do that but I gave it to a family member   It still worked  I hated that you couldn t take the pump out of the bag  though  Dragging that bag everywhere was a pain and was not discrete but it was the best pump on the market at the time When I became pregnant with my son in 2010  surprise   I knew I needed a pump  I was attracted to the Freestyle because it was so small  portable and wasn t attached to a bag  When you pump exclusively  you have to be able to pump whenever and wherever you need to so I chose it over the PIS even though I knew that the PIS could stand up to pumping 8 times per day  I just assumed that because the Medela brand is so respected that their top of the line pump would be able to meet my needs  I also stuck it in a Petunia Pickle Bottom bag which is much cuter than the tote bags that come with these pumps My son was born premature in April and ended up in the NICU  I was given a Medela Symphony with the kit to use while hospitalized to build up my milk supply  I used that for one week and then started using my Freestyle and taking the expressed milk into the unit for my son  The Freestyle worked as well as the Symphony in building my milk supply and I was able to express all my milk in 15 minutes and get large volumes  I used the pump everywhere with a breastfeeding cover  I pumped in the car  in the ladies lounge  in lactation rooms at Babies R Us  in the NICU  at my daughter s school  etc  It is so convenient   I could not have been happier and didn t mind the  370  I spent on the pump About three weeks ago I started to have issues with low volume when I pumped  I have an overabundant milk supply so I thought it was strange that I was having problems  I replaced the valves  I had only been using the pump for 7 weeks so I was annoyed that the valve already needed to be replaced  and I still got varying degrees of milk  I started Fenugreek and included more water in my diet  The problems persisted until I ended up with a clogged milk duct three days ago with no volume at all out of one breast  I had to pump for 45 minutes to get any milk at all out of the non clogged breast  BTW  the pump cuts itself off at 32 minutes so I had to restart it each time   I didn t think it was my pump since I never had any problems with the PIS and the pump was still making its WAH WAH noise so out of desperation  I paid a private lactation consultant  100 to meet with her  The first thing she did was test the suction on my Freestyle  It was HALF what it should have been even jacked all the way up to L8  I have only been using the pump for 11 weeks and the motor burned out  There is no way I could continue to use it unless I wanted to lose my milk supply  My son has terrible reflux and can t tolerate formula so the faulty pump was a crisis at my house  So  I rented a Medela Lactina hospital grade pump for  50 bucks and I was able to recover  I am using it as I write this but I am going back to work in two weeks and I can t possibly tote the Lactina to work  Plus  I already spent  400 on the Freestyle and don t want to keep paying the rental fees on the Lactina I called Medela this morning and they are replacing the pump  no questions asked  I don t even have the receipt anymore and they were fine with that  They are even overnighting it to me  The ease with which they agreed to replace my pump makes me wonder if they know there is an issue with this pump  The customer service was wonderful which is such a relief since you can t always count on that  The rep let me know that the pump motor had been redesigned and I shouldn t have any more problems with it  including the black dust problem which I also had  Who knows if that is true  I am certainly going to be more on top of any volume issues this time So   PROS  Convenience  convenience  convenience   you can take this pump anywhere   Works as well as a hospital grade pump  assuming the motor keeps going  and you can establish a milk supply with it  If you only plan to pump two or three times a day while away from your baby  it is probably a great pumpCONS It does not seem to be durable enough for exclusive pumping  The PIS worked like a charm for exclusive pumping   Expense   it is the most expensive personal pump on the market so it is very annoying that quality didn t match price The Softshields that come with the pump turn yellow and warp  meaning they will need to be replaced frequently  I replaced the first set within days of first using them because I put them in the steam sterilizer and they warped   would have been nice if Medela had let me know not to do this   cost  14   Once my milk supply was established  the Softshields were too small for my breasts and I had to purchase the larger size hard plastic shields  costing me another  14  They also are not as comfortable as the Softshields   The valve has to be replaced frequently and you have to buy the entire portion that attaches to the shields  You can t just replace the rubber valve  cost  19    Taking all the parts apart and cleaning them after every pump is annoying and time consuming  Much more complicated than the PIS parts   It is finicky   if you don t have the parts snapped on just right  there is no suction  I have to adjust multiple times while pumping   It leaks milk on you if you bend over because of a giant gap in the part that holds the valve  I ve lost ounces   The Freestyle cost me  370 for the pump   14 to replace the less then durable Softshields   14 to purchase larger breast shields since the pump only comes with one size   19 to replace the valves   100 to meet with the LC and  50 to rent the Lactina   Not to mention the stress it caused me by losing suction and messing up my milk supply and the pain of the clogged duct  Thanks to the Lactina  my supply has been saved and I am back to only having to pump for 15 minutes  I certainly hope the new Freestyle doesn t die on me My advice  if you plan on doing a lot of pumping  or find yourself needing to even though it wasn t your plan   get the PIS Metro bag  It seems to combine the best of both worlds   a reliable  strong pump that is more portable than the regular PIS because you can remove the pump from the bag  It is also cheaper I hope this helps someone make a better choice than I did  I really wish I had the PIS Metro bag but can t justify spending anymore money on breast pumps "},{"key":"review","value":"0.0"},{"key":"review","value":"[-405.7956916274106,405.7956916274106]"},{"key":"review","value":"1.0"}],[{"key":"sentiment","value":"Roan

baby was sleeping in pram or I would just sent helper out with kids and enjoy some quite time at home Let me tell you one thing that out weights everything else  babies sleep much better outside then inside  at home  I guess the fresh air and a lot of oxygen make the trick   so  whenever it was possible I took them outside  I was not happy using a car seat or other strollers for that as I worried about their back and spine  The pram from other side keeps their back in correct position as it has flat and firm bottom  I think none of the strollers that you convert from one position to another provides such a nice flat surface for baby  specially for newborns  to sleep soundly for few hours   When our first daughter got bigger we used this pram with seat unit and visited a lot of places like zoo  botanic garden and parks  The amortization is great and it gives very smooth ride  while kids in other strollers were trembling all the way Here are few things I really love about this pram   Smart  It has the smoothest ride on bouncy sidewalks and park trails  I guess it is because of pram s suspension and large air pumped wheels  Bassinet is large enough that I use it for quite long time  It even fits now my 5 months old in snowsuit bundled in wool sleeping bag and there is some space left   Folded chassis  You can detach bassinet seat unit and fold the chassis just in few minutes  Cargo of our sedan provides enough space to put chassis and seat there  the bassinet is too high to put into the cargo with chassis   We also used to detach the bassinet with baby sleeping in it and bring it inside  it has handles to carry  when the weather gets really rough or when we have to go home and I don t want to wake her up   The seat bassinet can face both ways  It s not so important for bassinet  but very nice for seat unit as babies grow they want to see more and enjoy the ride observing  The back of the seat and the footrest can be adjusted up and down and they can make quite a long flat surface for toddler to sleep   Rain cover  I paid extra  but looks like its included here  allows you to be safe in any weather condition  I used it during snow and windy time also    You can easily adjust height of the handle  it was great for us because we  my husband and I  are really different sizes   The metal basket provides enough space to put some things when you out and it s very convenient  I actually used it to take some toys on playground with us Bottom line I think Rocco is an excellent pram stroller and I use this pram all the time and I don t know what I would do without it  The only thing I regret they didn t sell it here before

Black"},{"key":"rawPrediction","value":"I was looking for a lightweight carrier to leave in the car or diaper bag when we are on vacation for short wears as my baby is fearful in public of strangers etc I am very much into babywearing and am a huge fan of Boba and tout the Boba 3G all the time to my friends   I use the 3G multiple times a week   It s very comfortable and my 1 year old  25 pound  baby loves it   We have used it since birth and it has grown with us I thought the Boba Air  BA  would be great for the summer since it s more lightweight and we do get pretty hot in the 3G   I was so excited to get it in the mail   I also have a Bitybean  BB  and so I was excited to compare them   I was sure the BA would blow BB out of the water NOT SO The big thing to me was the straps  The BA has wider straps than the BB   This is the only improvement I see in it over the BB   FYI  The BA does not have padding in the straps and there is a thick wire in the seam closest to your neck   It s horrible and I hate the wire   The straps pull down at the shoulders and don t distribute the weight to the waist like the 3G   It could be that I have a chunky baby  but he is well within the weight limits for the carrier My comparison of the Bitybean and the Boba AirStraps  BB has narrow and they are not super comfortable  BA has wide and they are not comfortable eitherFabric   BB is very thin and stretchy  almost like a wetsuit combined with a raincoat    It has breathable mesh  BA doesn t have any mesh  but is a thin fabric Comfort  BB pulls at the shoulders  BA pulls at the shouldersCompactness  BB wins by a mile  It folds up into a bag about the size of a waterbottle and can be stowed in the side pocket of a diaper bag   BA folds up into it s own pocket and is about the size of a clutch purse or a 4 diapers stacked together Design   BB comes in 4 colors and the design is more sleek   BA comes in black and blue on Amazon  I have seen white    I find black to be hotter in the sun Getting Wet   BB can be used in the pool  needs to be rinsed after   BA can get sprinkled on but not submersed Accessories   BB has a hood sold separately   15  and a fleece insert   19    I consider the hood to be a necessity   BA comes with the hood  no extra cost   Bonus for BA Cost   BB is  60    15 for the hood  BA is  65   hood is included Overall  I feel like lots of thought has gone into the BB to make it wonderful and the BA was an afterthought of the 3G   The BA is getting returned to Amazon and the BB is the winner in our house   I hope in a later edition they will make the waist and shoulder straps wider  that would make a huge difference

Organic Cotton Terry Dribble Bibs - Shades of Pink"},{"key":"prediction","value":"When baby hit 3 months she turned into a drool machine  Most of the bibs I had were those little cheapos that are made of some thin synthetic fabric that soaks through right away  I searched amazon for the best bibs for droolers and picked a few with decent reviews to try aden   anais 3 Pack Nibble Snap BibsImse Vimse Organic Cotton Terry Dribble BibsTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding BibBaby is now 7 months and the drooling is gone  so we re not using bibs much at the moment  When I was using them  I liked the aden and anais best The Imse Vimse are very small which would have been fine for my purpose and they had the nicest colors to me  fairly nuetral so they went with most outfits  They also fit nice and snug around the neck due to the tie  The bib cotton was thick and absorbent  but I rarely used them because the edging is made with some terrible rough fabric  If it s cotton  they must be breeding a new special type with the texture of    gosh  I m trying to think of a fabric with such a terrible texture  but I don t know what it would be  Suffice it to say that it doesn t belong in the sensitive neck rolls of a little baby  So  these got very little use The Tommy Tippy are nice and probably well suited to keeping milk out of the neck rolls  but the bib itself is a thin synthetic material and not all that absorbant  So  they soak through too quickly to be of much use for a serious drooling problem  The bib size is perfect  not tiny like the Imse Vimse and not huge like Aden and Anais  I don t love the velcro  you have to be careful that it doesn t snag other things in the wash and if you don t line it up perfectly it can irritate baby s skin  The snaps on Aden and Anais are better Finally  my favorite ended up being the Aden and Anais which are designed for eating  not drooling  They are huge  more of a smock on a 3 month old  but this is perfect for an eating bib  At three months baby wasn t mobile yet  so being too large was no biggie  if I need to resume use  it may interfere with her crawling as they hang past the waist  They were also a big big around the neck for little one but we didn t seem to have a big probelm with the drool running into her neck so this worked out ok  The reason I loved them is that they are so soft and so absorbant  they never soaked through with the drool and I could take the long bib and wipe her face with it  The Imse Vimse were too small for this and the Tommy Tippy not absorbant enough  Another possible advantage is the rather loud pattern does not show stains as much as the plainer bibs  I do wish they came in more color options  I don t love either choice  but on the whole I am happy and I know these will last forever  like the Aden and Anais blankets  they just get better with washing

Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce"},{"value":"It s always fun to write a review on those products that not only worked out great but also were a smashing value  to boot   This  along with the 8 oz version that we also used  is one of those products When I told my wife how much I loved these bottles  she just shook her head as if to say  The poor man has gone mental    Sure  I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles  but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value   Also  I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial  terrifying  experience to shopping for feeding supplies   It was my mission  you see  to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work    baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk      No problem  I thought   Go to the store  grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes  I thought   Whoa   First time parents  you know what I am talking about   go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled  feeding  and there it is   a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long    seemed like 100 feet long at the time   Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles  and we re not even talking about nipples   My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later  exhausted and overwhelmed   With no bottles   OK  so the review   We wanted bottles with no BPA  which was beginning to make big news a few years ago  so we explored non BPA options   There were plastic ones  but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were    you know  PETE  HDPE  LDPE  etc  with those little triangles on the bottom   That made me unsure of plastic   Then we considered glass   Would they break   Sure  if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface  but we decided we d be careful   So  these glass bottles have no BPA   Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing  so we don t have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing   And  another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesn t wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings   These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass  so they ll wear out when the bottle wears out   Which is never They are colorless   We like that also   You can see what s in the bottle  and you can also tell when they are clean   I mean  there s nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots  right   We ve seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time  and I don t like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinking They are durable   Unless you clean them with steel wool  these bottles won t scratch   Can t say that about plastic   They also won t melt  either  when you boil them to sterilize   BPA free plastic may be great when it is cold  but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees   Any glass is breakable  but our daughter didn t break a single one in almost two years   And she tried   I found them to be as sturdy  when using and cleaning them  as our drinking glasses   No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass  but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with baby s bottles than with any other glass she is around   car windows  house windows  drinking glasses  dishes  etc    When baby turned to toddler  however  the deal s off  as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold   Nowadays it s nothing but titanium plates and bowls for her   Value   This one s a biggie   Nothing s too good for my daughter  a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth  I reckon   But these are reasonable   You ve seen other glass bottles  the ones that ape the  no BPA  angle  the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles   Yikes   I looked at them  and they re fine bottles  but we re talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument  for me   Besides  I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple  but also a top cap  and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple    ask me how I know Other nice things   These come in common sense sizes  4 and 8 ounces   Also  they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves   for those of you so inclined   so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge   Cool    yeah  my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this   Most importantly of all  they worked great for our daughter   No gas  no fussiness  no issues at all with the nipples  which do vent    there s a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you don t over tighten the ring Are these bottles perfect   Not universally  I m sure  but they were perfect for us and we ll be using them for our next little one   One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary    they come with different flow rates    Who knew

Freestyle Breast Pump","I owned a PIS when I was expressing for my daughter 8 years ago and I never had any problems with it  I was an exclusive pumper and maintained a very good milk supply with my PIS for over 6 months until my daughter was eating baby food and I stopped pumping  I made enough milk I could have fed a small village  We weren t planning on having any more children so I gave the pump away after a few years  I know you aren t supposed to do that but I gave it to a family member   It still worked  I hated that you couldn t take the pump out of the bag  though  Dragging that bag everywhere was a pain and was not discrete but it was the best pump on the market at the time When I became pregnant with my son in 2010  surprise   I knew I needed a pump  I was attracted to the Freestyle because it was so small  portable and wasn t attached to a bag  When you pump exclusively  you have to be able to pump whenever and wherever you need to so I chose it over the PIS even though I knew that the PIS could stand up to pumping 8 times per day  I just assumed that because the Medela brand is so respected that their top of the line pump would be able to meet my needs  I also stuck it in a Petunia Pickle Bottom bag which is much cuter than the tote bags that come with these pumps My son was born premature in April and ended up in the NICU  I was given a Medela Symphony with the kit to use while hospitalized to build up my milk supply  I used that for one week and then started using my Freestyle and taking the expressed milk into the unit for my son  The Freestyle worked as well as the Symphony in building my milk supply and I was able to express all my milk in 15 minutes and get large volumes  I used the pump everywhere with a breastfeeding cover  I pumped in the car  in the ladies lounge  in lactation rooms at Babies R Us  in the NICU  at my daughter s school  etc  It is so convenient   I could not have been happier and didn t mind the  370  I spent on the pump About three weeks ago I started to have issues with low volume when I pumped  I have an overabundant milk supply so I thought it was strange that I was having problems  I replaced the valves  I had only been using the pump for 7 weeks so I was annoyed that the valve already needed to be replaced  and I still got varying degrees of milk  I started Fenugreek and included more water in my diet  The problems persisted until I ended up with a clogged milk duct three days ago with no volume at all out of one breast  I had to pump for 45 minutes to get any milk at all out of the non clogged breast  BTW  the pump cuts itself off at 32 minutes so I had to restart it each time   I didn t think it was my pump since I never had any problems with the PIS and the pump was still making its WAH WAH noise so out of desperation  I paid a private lactation consultant  100 to meet with her  The first thing she did was test the suction on my Freestyle  It was HALF what it should have been even jacked all the way up to L8  I have only been using the pump for 11 weeks and the motor burned out  There is no way I could continue to use it unless I wanted to lose my milk supply  My son has terrible reflux and can t tolerate formula so the faulty pump was a crisis at my house  So  I rented a Medela Lactina hospital grade pump for  50 bucks and I was able to recover  I am using it as I write this but I am going back to work in two weeks and I can t possibly tote the Lactina to work  Plus  I already spent  400 on the Freestyle and don t want to keep paying the rental fees on the Lactina I called Medela this morning and they are replacing the pump  no questions asked  I don t even have the receipt anymore and they were fine with that  They are even overnighting it to me  The ease with which they agreed to replace my pump makes me wonder if they know there is an issue with this pump  The customer service was wonderful which is such a relief since you can t always count on that  The rep let me know that the pump motor had been redesigned and I shouldn t have any more problems with it  including the black dust problem which I also had  Who knows if that is true  I am certainly going to be more on top of any volume issues this time So   PROS  Convenience  convenience  convenience   you can take this pump anywhere   Works as well as a hospital grade pump  assuming the motor keeps going  and you can establish a milk supply with it  If you only plan to pump two or three times a day while away from your baby  it is probably a great pumpCONS It does not seem to be durable enough for exclusive pumping  The PIS worked like a charm for exclusive pumping   Expense   it is the most expensive personal pump on the market so it is very annoying that quality didn t match price The Softshields that come with the pump turn yellow and warp  meaning they will need to be replaced frequently  I replaced the first set within days of first using them because I put them in the steam sterilizer and they warped   would have been nice if Medela had let me know not to do this   cost  14   Once my milk supply was established  the Softshields were too small for my breasts and I had to purchase the larger size hard plastic shields  costing me another  14  They also are not as comfortable as the Softshields   The valve has to be replaced frequently and you have to buy the entire portion that attaches to the shields  You can t just replace the rubber valve  cost  19    Taking all the parts apart and cleaning them after every pump is annoying and time consuming  Much more complicated than the PIS parts   It is finicky   if you don t have the parts snapped on just right  there is no suction  I have to adjust multiple times while pumping   It leaks milk on you if you bend over because of a giant gap in the part that holds the valve  I ve lost ounces   The Freestyle cost me  370 for the pump   14 to replace the less then durable Softshields   14 to purchase larger breast shields since the pump only comes with one size   19 to replace the valves   100 to meet with the LC and  50 to rent the Lactina   Not to mention the stress it caused me by losing suction and messing up my milk supply and the pain of the clogged duct  Thanks to the Lactina  my supply has been saved and I am back to only having to pump for 15 minutes  I certainly hope the new Freestyle doesn t die on me My advice  if you plan on doing a lot of pumping  or find yourself needing to even though it wasn t your plan   get the PIS Metro bag  It seems to combine the best of both worlds   a reliable  strong pump that is more portable than the regular PIS because you can remove the pump from the bag  It is also cheaper I hope this helps someone make a better choice than I did  I really wish I had the PIS Metro bag but can t justify spending anymore money on breast pumps ","0.0","[-405.7956916274106,405.7956916274106]","1.0"],["Roan Rocco Classic Pram Stroller 2-in-1 with Bassinet and Seat Unit - Coffee","Great Pram Rocco      I bought this pram from Europe  unfortunately it was not available on Amazon back then and cost me tons of money  This pram is so great I ve decided to give my opinion on it First of all let me notice that I can t imagine how to raise kids without pram  I have three kids and it was the most useful and practical purchase for baby I made  even I paid a fortune for it back then   I used it everyday all year around  When you have kids specially newborns and toddlers  you don t get much excise plus I was getting really tired staying at home  So  I compensated it by long walks around neighborhood with our first baby and then taking toddlers to playground or for a walk while baby was sleeping in pram or I would just sent helper out with kids and enjoy some quite time at home Let me tell you one thing that out weights everything else  babies sleep much better outside then inside  at home  I guess the fresh air and a lot of oxygen make the trick   so  whenever it was possible I took them outside  I was not happy using a car seat or other strollers for that as I worried about their back and spine  The pram from other side keeps their back in correct position as it has flat and firm bottom  I think none of the strollers that you convert from one position to another provides such a nice flat surface for baby  specially for newborns  to sleep soundly for few hours   When our first daughter got bigger we used this pram with seat unit and visited a lot of places like zoo  botanic garden and parks  The amortization is great and it gives very smooth ride  while kids in other strollers were trembling all the way Here are few things I really love about this pram   Smart  It has the smoothest ride on bouncy sidewalks and park trails  I guess it is because of pram s suspension and large air pumped wheels  Bassinet is large enough that I use it for quite long time  It even fits now my 5 months old in snowsuit bundled in wool sleeping bag and there is some space left   Folded chassis  You can detach bassinet seat unit and fold the chassis just in few minutes  Cargo of our sedan provides enough space to put chassis and seat there  the bassinet is too high to put into the cargo with chassis   We also used to detach the bassinet with baby sleeping in it and bring it inside  it has handles to carry  when the weather gets really rough or when we have to go home and I don t want to wake her up   The seat bassinet can face both ways  It s not so important for bassinet  but very nice for seat unit as babies grow they want to see more and enjoy the ride observing  The back of the seat and the footrest can be adjusted up and down and they can make quite a long flat surface for toddler to sleep   Rain cover  I paid extra  but looks like its included here  allows you to be safe in any weather condition  I used it during snow and windy time also    You can easily adjust height of the handle  it was great for us because we  my husband and I  are really different sizes   The metal basket provides enough space to put some things when you out and it s very convenient  I actually used it to take some toys on playground with us Bottom line I think Rocco is an excellent pram stroller and I use this pram all the time and I don t know what I would do without it  The only thing I regret they didn t sell it here before   ","1.0","[-395.00675751755034,395.00675751755034]","1.0"],["Boba Air Baby Carrier, Black","I was looking for a lightweight carrier to leave in the car or diaper bag when we are on vacation for short wears as my baby is fearful in public of strangers etc I am very much into babywearing and am a huge fan of Boba and tout the Boba 3G all the time to my friends   I use the 3G multiple times a week   It s very comfortable and my 1 year old  25 pound  baby loves it   We have used it since birth and it has grown with us I thought the Boba Air  BA  would be great for the summer since it s more lightweight and we do get pretty hot in the 3G   I was so excited to get it in the mail   I also have a Bitybean  BB  and so I was excited to compare them   I was sure the BA would blow BB out of the water NOT SO The big thing to me was the straps  The BA has wider straps than the BB   This is the only improvement I see in it over the BB   FYI  The BA does not have padding in the straps and there is a thick wire in the seam closest to your neck   It s horrible and I hate the wire   The straps pull down at the shoulders and don t distribute the weight to the waist like the 3G   It could be that I have a chunky baby  but he is well within the weight limits for the carrier My comparison of the Bitybean and the Boba AirStraps  BB has narrow and they are not super comfortable  BA has wide and they are not comfortable eitherFabric   BB is very thin and stretchy  almost like a wetsuit combined with a raincoat    It has breathable mesh  BA doesn t have any mesh  but is a thin fabric Comfort  BB pulls at the shoulders  BA pulls at the shouldersCompactness  BB wins by a mile  It folds up into a bag about the size of a waterbottle and can be stowed in the side pocket of a diaper bag   BA folds up into it s own pocket and is about the size of a clutch purse or a 4 diapers stacked together Design   BB comes in 4 colors and the design is more sleek   BA comes in black and blue on Amazon  I have seen white    I find black to be hotter in the sun Getting Wet   BB can be used in the pool  needs to be rinsed after   BA can get sprinkled on but not submersed Accessories   BB has a hood sold separately   15  and a fleece insert   19    I consider the hood to be a necessity   BA comes with the hood  no extra cost   Bonus for BA Cost   BB is  60    15 for the hood  BA is  65   hood is included Overall  I feel like lots of thought has gone into the BB to make it wonderful and the BA was an afterthought of the 3G   The BA is getting returned to Amazon and the BB is the winner in our house   I hope in a later edition they will make the waist and shoulder straps wider  that would make a huge difference

were those little cheapos that are made of some thin synthetic fabric that soaks through right away  I searched amazon for the best bibs for droolers and picked a few with decent reviews to try aden   anais 3 Pack Nibble Snap BibsImse Vimse Organic Cotton Terry Dribble BibsTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding BibBaby is now 7 months and the drooling is gone  so we re not using bibs much at the moment  When I was using them  I liked the aden and anais best The Imse Vimse are very small which would have been fine for my purpose and they had the nicest colors to me  fairly nuetral so they went with most outfits  They also fit nice and snug around the neck due to the tie  The bib cotton was thick and absorbent  but I rarely used them because the edging is made with some terrible rough fabric  If it s cotton  they must be breeding a new special type with the texture of    gosh  I m trying to think of a fabric with such a terrible texture  but I don t know what it would be  Suffice it to say that it doesn t belong in the sensitive neck rolls of a little baby  So  these got very little use The Tommy Tippy are nice and probably well suited to keeping milk out of the neck rolls  but the bib itself is a thin synthetic material and not all that absorbant  So  they soak through too quickly to be of much use for a serious drooling problem  The bib size is perfect  not tiny like the Imse Vimse and not huge like Aden and Anais  I don t love the velcro  you have to be careful that it doesn t snag other things in the wash and if you don t line it up perfectly it can irritate baby s skin  The snaps on Aden and Anais are better Finally  my favorite ended up being the Aden and Anais which are designed for eating  not drooling  They are huge  more of a smock on a 3 month old  but this is perfect for an eating bib  At three months baby wasn t mobile yet  so being too large was no biggie  if I need to resume use  it may interfere with her crawling as they hang past the waist  They were also a big big around the neck for little one but we didn t seem to have a big probelm with the drool running into her neck so this worked out ok  The reason I loved them is that they are so soft and so absorbant  they never soaked through with the drool and I could take the long bib and wipe her face with it  The Imse Vimse were too small for this and the Tommy Tippy not absorbant enough  Another possible advantage is the rather loud pattern does not show stains as much as the plainer bibs  I do wish they came in more color options  I don t love either choice  but on the whole I am happy and I know these will last forever  like the Aden and Anais blankets  they just get better with washing ","0.0","[-333.60166337282146,333.60166337282146]","1.0"],["Roan Rocco Classic Pram

4-Ounce","It s always fun to write a review on those products that not only worked out great but also were a smashing value  to boot   This  along with the 8 oz version that we also used  is one of those products When I told my wife how much I loved these bottles  she just shook her head as if to say  The poor man has gone mental    Sure  I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles  but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value   Also  I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial  terrifying  experience to shopping for feeding supplies   It was my mission  you see  to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work    baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk      No problem  I thought   Go to the store  grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes  I thought   Whoa   First time parents  you know what I am talking about   go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled  feeding  and there it is   a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long    seemed like 100 feet long at the time   Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles  and we re not even talking about nipples   My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later  exhausted and overwhelmed   With no bottles   OK  so the review   We wanted bottles with no BPA  which was beginning to make big news a few years ago  so we explored non BPA options   There were plastic ones  but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were    you know  PETE  HDPE  LDPE  etc  with those little triangles on the bottom   That made me unsure of plastic   Then we considered glass   Would they break   Sure  if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface  but we decided we d be careful   So  these glass bottles have no BPA   Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing  so we don t have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing   And  another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesn t wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings   These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass  so they ll wear out when the bottle wears out   Which is never They are colorless   We like that also   You can see what s in the bottle  and you can also tell when they are clean   I mean  there s nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots  right   We ve seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time  and I don t like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinking They are durable   Unless you clean them with steel wool  these bottles won t scratch   Can t say that about plastic   They also won t melt  either  when you boil them to sterilize   BPA free plastic may be great when it is cold  but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees   Any glass is breakable  but our daughter didn t break a single one in almost two years   And she tried   I found them to be as sturdy  when using and cleaning them  as our drinking glasses   No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass  but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with baby s bottles than with any other glass she is around   car windows  house windows  drinking glasses  dishes  etc    When baby turned to toddler  however  the deal s off  as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold   Nowadays it s nothing but titanium plates and bowls for her   Value   This one s a biggie   Nothing s too good for my daughter  a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth  I reckon   But these are reasonable   You ve seen other glass bottles  the ones that ape the  no BPA  angle  the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles   Yikes   I looked at them  and they re fine bottles  but we re talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument  for me   Besides  I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple  but also a top cap  and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple    ask me how I know Other nice things   These come in common sense sizes  4 and 8 ounces   Also  they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves   for those of you so inclined   so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge   Cool    yeah  my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this   Most importantly of all  they worked great for our daughter   No gas  no fussiness  no issues at all with the nipples  which do vent    there s a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you don t over tighten the ring Are these bottles perfect   Not universally  I m sure  but they were perfect for us and we ll be using them for our next little one   One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary    they come with different flow rates    Who knew
